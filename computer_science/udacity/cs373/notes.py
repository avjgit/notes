----------------- probability
normalized = if sum of probabilities is 1
convolution = funciton overlapping
sample space = set of all possible outcomes

P(X|Z) = probability of event X, given Z
P(Heads | Normal coin) = 1/2
P(Heads | Coin-with-two-heads) = 1

Bayes' Rule
"what is the probability that the coin is normal, given that it came up heads?"
P(X|Z) = (P(Z|X) P(X)) / P(Z)
P(Normal coin | Heads) = (P(Heads | Normal coin) P(Normal coin)) / P(Heads)
P(Normal coin | Heads) = (1/2 * 1/2) / 1/2 = 1/4 / 1/2 = 1/2??

Total Probability Theorem = P of event occuring is sum of probabilities of all possible ways it can occur
