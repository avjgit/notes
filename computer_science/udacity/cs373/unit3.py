# 7 Using Robot Class
myrobot = robot()
myrobot.set(10.0, 10.0, 0.0)
print myrobot
# => x=10, y=10, heading = 0
# myrobot.move(angle, distance)
myrobot.move(0, 10)
# => x=20, y=10, heading = 0
myrobot.move(pi/2, 10.)
# => x=10, y=20, heading = 1.57
print myrobot.sense()
# prints distance to four landmarks
