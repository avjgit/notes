# CS387 - APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY
Description: Cryptography is about “secret writing”. In this class, we will introduce the mathematical foundations of cryptography and build programs to perform encryption. We will see how to use cryptography to solve important problem such as how to authenticate users, secure websites, and do computation without exposing up your data. We will also look at the things that can go wrong when cryptography is misused or implemented badly.
### WEEK 1:Symmetric Encryption
Sending messages when two people share a secret
### WEEK 2:Authentication
Using symmetric encryption to manage passwords securely
### WEEK 3:Asymmetric Encryption
Public-key cryptosystems
### WEEK 4:Public-key Protocols
Secure commerce, certificates
### WEEK 5:Digital Cash
How to make money from numbers alone
### WEEK 6:Secure Computation
Computing without exposing data
### WEEK 7:Wrap-up
Problems cryptography can and cannot solve
