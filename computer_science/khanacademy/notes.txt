### Basic Probability    
P = 
    # of possibilities that meet my criteria/
    # of all likely possibilities

### Simple Probability    
3 Y, 2 R, 2 G, 1 B = 8
P(Y) = 3/8

### Probability with Playing Cards and Venn Diagrams    
cards
4 suits
13 types = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 , 19, J, Q, K, A
P(jack) = 4/ 52
P(heart) = 1/4 or ... 13/52
P(jack and heart) = 1/52
P(jack or heart) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 
      P(jack)
    + P(heart)
    - P(jack and heart)?

### Addition Rule for Probability    
8gq, 9gs, 5yq, 7ys = 29
P(q) = (8 + 5) / 29 = 13/29
P(y) = (5 + 7) / 29 = 12/29
P(yq) = 5 / 29
P(y or q) = (12 + 13 - 5) / 29

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A & B)


true also for mutually exclusive cases

### Compound Probability of Independent Events    
P(H H) = 1/4
  2x2
P(THT) = P(T) * P(H) * P(T) = 1/8

### Probability 1 Module Examples    
9R, 2B, 3G
P(nonB) = (9+3)/14

... 12/17

circles:
1) circumference = 36pi
2) area 16pi
what's 1'st area? 2R = 36, so, R = 18
so, area 1 = pi18*18 = 324pi
so, answer is = 16/324 ~5%

### Independent Events 1    
dependent: pulling winner out of bag, then pulling 2nd one

### Independent Events 2    
problem 1 with 4 choices,
problem 2 with 3 choices,
so, first, this is independent,
and is: 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12

### Independent Events 3    
even number three times = 1/2 ^ 3?
