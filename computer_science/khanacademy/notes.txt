### Basic Probability    
P = 
    # of possibilities that meet my criteria/
    # of all likely possibilities

### Simple Probability    
3 Y, 2 R, 2 G, 1 B = 8
P(Y) = 3/8

### Probability with Playing Cards and Venn Diagrams    
cards
4 suits
13 types = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 , 19, J, Q, K, A
P(jack) = 4/ 52
P(heart) = 1/4 or ... 13/52
P(jack and heart) = 1/52
P(jack or heart) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 
      P(jack)
    + P(heart)
    - P(jack and heart)?
