# Automata
This course will emphasize those aspects of the theory of automata that people really use in practice, including finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars.  

Jeff Ullman is the S. W. Ascherman Prof. of Engineering (emeritus) at Stanford University, where he taught in the Computer Science Dept. from 1979-2002. He worked at Bell Laboratories from 1966-1969, and taught at Princeton Univ. (from which he also received his PhD in 1966) between 1969 and 1979. He first taught Automata Theory in 1967 at Columbia University (from which he received his BS Degree in 1963), and has been teaching it periodically, ever since. He is the author or coauthor of widely read textbooks in Compilers, Databases, Algorithms, and Data Mining, as well as the book in Automata on which this course is based. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, winner of the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Education award, the IEEE Von Neumann Medal, and the Knuth Prize.
