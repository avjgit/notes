SET server:name "fido"
GET server:name

SETNX connections 10
INCR connections
INCR connections
DEL connections
INCR connections


========================== q?
- are redis commands case sensitive? SET not set?
========================== text:
Redis is what is called a key-value store, often referred to as a NoSQL database. The essence of a key-value store is the ability to store some data, called a value, inside a key. This data can later be retrieved only if we know the exact key used to store it. We can use the command SET to store the value "fido" at key "server:name":


    SET server:name "fido"
Redis will store our data permanently, so we can later ask "What is the value stored at key server:name?" and Redis will reply with "fido":


    GET server:name => "fido"

Other common operations provided by key-value stores are DEL to delete a given key and associated value, SET-if-not-exists (called SETNX on Redis) that sets a key only if it does not already exist, and INCR to atomically increment a number stored at a given key:


    SET connections 10
    INCR connections => 11
    INCR connections => 12
    DEL connections
    INCR connections => 1
